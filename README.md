# Ethereum Galaxy

## Visualizing Ethereum transactions as a 3D graph

Ethereum Galaxy shows a 3D representation of the transactions happened in the latest 24h on the Ethereum network, allowing to choose between the 1h, 4h, 6h, 12h or 24h visualization and to download all the data in Pajek format for network analysis.

## Development

Project is divided in three branches:

*   `master`, current stable version of visualizer
*   `gh-pages`, data needed for visualization
*   `devel`, development branch

---

Ethereum Galaxy requires those files generated by the [Ethereum Galaxy Server](https://github.com/Ross94/ethereum-galaxy-server)

*   `positions.bin`, nodes 3D positions
*   `links.bin`, link between nodes
*   `labels.json`, an array mapping a label to each node
*   `info.json`, graph informations (i.e. block range and node/link count)

---

## Run

Run requires download of `master` and `gh-pages` branches in two different folders.
After download for each forlder:

*   `npm install`, install dependencies
*   `npm start`, run scripts

Start `gh-pages` before `master`.
