# Ethereum Galaxy

## Visualizing Ethereum transactions as a 3D graph

Ethereum Galaxy shows a 3D representation of the transactions happened in the latest 24h on the Ethereum network, allowing to choose between the 1h or 4h visualization and to download all the data in Pajek format for network analysis.

## Development

Ethereum Galaxy requires those files generated by the [Ethereum Galaxy Server](https://github.com/loopingdoge/ethereum-galaxy-server)

*   `positions.bin`, nodes 3D positions
*   `links.bin`, link between nodes
*   `labels.json`, an array mapping a label to each node
*   `info.json`, graph informations (i.e. block range and node/link count)

Ethereum Galaxy has been inspired by [anvaka/pm](http://anvaka.github.io/pm/#/?_k=k0tzg1) and uses [ethplorer.io](ethplorer.io) API to provide addresses information
